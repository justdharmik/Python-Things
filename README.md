# Python-Things
This repository consists of few small snippets of codes i wrote as practice/exercise while learning **Python**!

<h3>1. The Weight Converter.</h3>
This particular snippet of code was my first task (after the <b>Hello, World!</b> program). <br>As it's name suggests, it is a weight converter which will tell your weight in Lbs or Kg. <br>
Input your weight in either Lbs or Kg, then tell the code in which unit your wait is. <br>
<b>Example:</b> <br>
<pre>
<code><i> >>> Enter your weight: 160</i> <br>
 >>> (L)bs or (K)g: L <br>
 >>> Your weight in Kgs is : 72.0 Kilos<br></code>
</pre>
In this way, convert kilos to pounds or vice versa and play around!

<h3>2. The Car Engine.</h3>
This code consist of a non GUI game (not a exactly a game) which one can play around and enjoy.<br>
You can turn ON/OFF an imaginary car. :car: 
Let me show you...
PS: When you run the code, you see a tip.
<pre>
<i> Tip - try using 'help'
 >>> help
 Instructions:
 start - To start the car.
 stop - To stop the car.
 help - To display this message.
 quit/exit - To exit the game.
 >>> start
 Car Engine On! Ready to go.
 >>> start
 It is ON already!
 >>> stop
 Engine Stopped.
 >>> quit
 Hope to see you soon.</i>
</pre>
So this was a fun game <i>(really? ü§™)</i> made as a practice while learning <b>Loops and Conditional Statements.</b>

<h3>3. Field Length Notifier.</h3>
Often on different webpages you might have noticed that you can input limited characters in a field or input <i>(in html language)</i>.<br>
Ever wondered how we could implement it using Python? <br>
Have a look!<br>
This code allows <b>Name</b> field to be more than 2 characters and less than 25 characters.<br>
<pre>
<i>Enter your name : Dharma
Name looks good! <br>

#---If name is less than 3 characters
Enter your name : dh
Name must be at east 3 characters long!


#---If name is more than 25 characters
Enter your name : dharmamamamamamamamamamamama
Name must be less than 25 characters!
Name Length: 28</i>
</pre>
Thats how a field length could be calculated and allow passing of values under required conditons.

<h3>4. The Emoji.</h3>
Often using emojis on desktop is but difficult as the physical keyboard doesn't have emojis.<br> Though there are many shortcuts and solutions available on the internet, this program can convert symbolic emojis to graphical emojis easily. How? i used a dictionary which consist of a symbolic = graphical emoji data. <br>
Here is an example:
<pre><i>Tips : 
:) - Smiley
:( - Sad
xD - Laugh
-_- - Groan
<3 - Heart <br>
> Hey :)
Hey üôÇ <br>
> Good Morning <3
Good Morning üíì <br>
> You are so funny xD
You are so funny ü§£</i></pre>
This is how it can convert symbolic emoji to a graphical emoji. <br>


<h4> To run any of the above programs, download ‚¨áÔ∏è the code and install PyCharm on your computer üíª  Have Fun!</h4>
